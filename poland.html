          <h3>History of Wieliczka Salt Mines</h3>
          <p>The Wieliczka and Bochnia salt mines are located on the same geological rock salt deposit in southern Poland. Situated close to each other, they were worked in parallel and continuously from the 13th century until the late 20th century, constituting one of the earliest and most important European industrial operations.</p>
          <p>The Wieliczka Salt Mine is now an official Polish Historic Monument (Pomnik Historii) and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its attractions include the shafts and labyrinthine passageways, displays of historic salt-mining technology, an underground lake, four chapels and numerous statues carved by miners out of the rock salt, and more recent sculptures by contemporary artists.</p>

          <h5>Princess Kinga</h5>
          <img src="./img/poland/Princess Kinga_580x480.png" alt="Princess Kinga with unique guide" class="img-responsive">
          <p>A legend about Princess Kinga, associated with the Wieliczka mine, tells of a Hungarian princess about to be married to Bolesław V the Chaste, the Prince of Kraków. As part of her dowry, she asked her father, Béla IV of Hungary, for a lump of salt, since salt was prizeworthy in Poland. Her father King Béla took her to a salt mine in Máramaros. She threw her engagement ring from Bolesław in one of the shafts before leaving for Poland. On arriving in Kraków, she asked the miners to dig a deep pit until they come upon a rock. The people found a lump of salt in there and when they split it in two, discovered the princess's ring. Kinga had thus become the patron saint of salt miners in and around the Polish capital.</p>
          <h5>Power of the Labyrinth scenes</h5>
          <img src="./img/poland/Power of the Labyrinth scenes_580x480.png" alt="Power of the Labyrinth scenes" class="img-responsive">
          <p>The Polish journalist and novelist Bolesław Prus described his 1878 visit to the salt mine in a remarkable series of three articles, "Kartki z podróży (Wieliczka)" ["Travel Notes (Wieliczka)"], in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), 1878, nos. 36–38. The great Prus scholar Zygmunt Szweykowski writes: "The power of the Labyrinth scenes [in Prus' 1895 historical novel, Pharaoh] stems, among other things, from the fact that they echo Prus' own experiences when visiting Wieliczka." The Wieliczka Salt Mine indeed helped inspire Pharaoh. Prus combined his powerful impressions of the salt mine with the description of the ancient Egyptian Labyrinth, in Book II of Herodotus' Histories, to produce the remarkable scenes found in chapters 56 and 63 of his novel.</p>

          <h5>St. Kinga's Chapel</h5>
          <img src="./img/poland/St. Kinga's Chapel_580x480.png" alt="St. Kinga Chapel Art" class="img-responsive">
          <p>St. Kinga's Chapel is located within the historic Wieliczka Salt Mine, 101 meters underground. A place of stunning beauty, the chapel has impressive salt carvings, reliefs, and chandeliers sculpted by skilled salt miners. Functioning as an underground church, the chapel served as a sanctuary for miners seeking solace and divine intervention during their arduous work.</p>
          <p>St. Kinga's Chapel's history goes back centuries and is intertwined with stories of devotion, craftsmanship, and legends. It is dedicated to St. Kinga, the patron saint of salt mine workers, and was built in 1896 by the salt miners. The underground chapel has been transformed into a space of remarkable beauty and spiritual importance throughout the centuries. Today, it continues to host church services, concerts, and even weddings.</p>
          <p>St. Kinga’s Chapel's mythical energy hits you in the face when you walk through it. Part of the reason could be its creation story. According to legend, when St. Kinga, the patroness of salt miners, arrived in Wieliczka, Poland, she tossed her engagement ring into a Hungarian salt mine as proof of her benevolence. Surprisingly, the ring traveled through underground passages and appeared in a lump of salt in Wieliczka. This event is commemorated in St. Kinga's Chapel and offers proof of its spiritual significance.</p>
          <h5>St. John Chapel</h5>
          <img src="./img/poland/St. John Chapel_580x480.png" alt="St John Chapel Art" class="img-responsive">
          <p>St John’s Chapel owes its unusual decoration to the historic wooden altar and the beautiful polychrome on the barrel vault ceiling. When visiting the Mine, note the 19th-century figure of Christ Crucified. The chapel is located 135 m underground, although it was originally located in the Lipowiec chamber on the Level I of the mine. In 2005, it was thoroughly restored and thus brought back to life. Currently, the chapel can be used to organise a small wedding ceremony or holy mass for a close family, such as on the occasion of a baptism. Up to 40 people can take part in the event.</p></div>
